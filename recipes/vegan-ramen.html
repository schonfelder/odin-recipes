    </p>
    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <h4> Ramen</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>15 ml grape seed or avocado oil</em></li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, roughly chopped <em>(5 cloves yield ~2 1/2 Tbsp or 18 g)</em></li>
            <li>1 7-cm piece ginger <em>(peeled and diced)</em></li>
            <li>110 g yellow onion <em>(coarsely chopped)</em></li>
            <li>1440 ml vegetable stock <em>(DIY or store-bought)</em></li>
            <li>30 ml tamari or soy sauce <em>(plus more to taste)</em></li>
            <li>14 g dehydrated shiitake mushrooms</li>
            <li>15 g white or yellow miso paste <em>(ensure vegan friendliness on package - I like this brand* available at Whole Foods)</em></li>
            <li>1 tsp toasted sesame oil <em>(for flavor // plus more to taste) </em></li>
            <li>227 g ramen noodles* <em>(ensure gluten-free and vegan-friendliness on package - I like this brand available at Whole Foods)</em></li>
        </ul>
    <h4> TOPPINGS <em>optional</em> </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>50 g chopped green onion <em>(for garnish)</em></li>
            <li>283 g extra-firm tofu <em>(flash “fried”*)</em></li>
            <li>Miso-glazed carrots*</li>
            <li>Miso-glazed baby bok choy*</li>
        </ul>
    <h3> Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large pot over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Once hot, add oil, garlic, ginger, and onion. Sauté, stirring occasionally for 5-8 minutes or until the onion has developed a slight sear (browned edges).</li>
            <li>Add 1 cup (240 ml // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) of the vegetable broth to deglaze the bottom of the pan. Use a whisk (or wooden spoon) to scrape up any bits that may have stuck to the bottom to enhance the flavor of the broth.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 5 cups (1200 ml // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) vegetable broth, tamari or soy sauce, and dehydrated mushrooms – stir.</li>
            <li>Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer on low for at least 1 hour, up to 2-3, stirring occasionally. The longer it cooks, the more the flavor will deepen and develop.</li>
            <li>Taste broth and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more soy sauce or sesame oil if desired. Add the miso paste at this time.</li>
            <li>When you’re 30 minutes from serving, prepare any desired toppings (see notes for miso-glazed carrots, baby bok choy, and quick-seared tofu).</li>
            <li>NOODLES: Fill a large saucepan or pot with water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add ramen noodles (depending on size of pan you may need to do this in two batches // use fewer or more batches if altering batch size) and cook according to package instructions – about 4-5 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Strain broth and reserve mushrooms for serving. (Save onions and ginger for serving as well, if desired, though I discarded them).</li>
            <li>To serve, divide ramen noodles between four (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) serving bowls. Top with strained broth and desired toppings, such as carrots, bok choy, green onion, or seared tofu. Serve with chili garlic sauce (found here) for added heat.</li>
            <li>Best when fresh, though the broth can be stored (separately) in the refrigerator for up to 5 days and in the freezer for up to 1 month.</li>
            <li>Enjoy with friends and family!</li>
